# Fundamentals of C#

## What does the C# language represent, and for which platforms and applications is it intended?

C# is a programming language created by Microsoft and part of the .NET platform. With C#, a variety of applications can be developed, such as desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications, gaming applications (via Unity), cloud computing solutions, and more. C# is supported across various platforms thanks to .NET Core and Xamarin.

## What’s the fundamental difference between .dll and .exe files in the context of C# projects?

In the context of C# and .NET, an .exe (executable) file is an executable that contains an entry point for the program. In other words, when you run an .exe file, the program starts its execution. On the other hand, a .dll (dynamic-link library) file is a code library that doesn’t have a direct entry point but can be called by another program or application. It’s a means of code reuse among different projects.

## How does the entry point of a program written in C# look?

The entry point in a C# program is typically represented by the Main() method, which is located in the Program class. This method must be static and serves as the starting point for the program’s execution. Usually, its structure looks like this:

> public class Program
>
> {
>
>     public static void Main(string[] args)
>
>     {
>
>        // program code
>
>     }
>
>}
